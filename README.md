# Hydro JS

Hydro JS is the perfect way to build robust interactive websites without limiting your creativity. It’s an agnostic, dependency-free library that just works.

## Purpose & Goals

Hydro JS is the Javascript aspect of the Hydro Framework. It’s purpose is to provide a simple yet powerful way to enhance your sites with common interactive elements.

It’s aim is to adapt; no assumptions are made about how your website is built and styled. It is not dependent on any additional stylesheets or Javascript libraries and can safely be included in over the top of any existing frameworks. Interactions added by the framework are bound to the elements only when absolutely necessary, allowing you to mix and match different types of interactions to a single element.

Performance is key. It leverages CSS transitions to provide smooth animations across all devices. It is wary of layout thrashing and how certain CSS properties can affect performance (i.e. transforms) and accounts for this by grouping DOM read/write commands and triggering hardware acceleration when necessary.

Naturally Hydro JS pairs best with Hydro CSS but you are not bound by our framework and are free to easily mix and match with anything else.
